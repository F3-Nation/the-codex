# **App Name**: F3 Codex

## Core Features:

- Unified Display: Display entries from both the Exicon and Lexicon, with clear distinction between the two.
- Advanced Search: Implement a robust search functionality that covers names, descriptions, and aliases. Filters can narrow searches within each.
- Admin Panel: Enable authenticated admins to easily manage (create, edit, remove) entries, including bulk operations, via a dedicated admin panel.
- User Submissions: Allow unauthenticated users to submit additions and edits to entries, with admin approval workflow.
- AI-Powered References: Use a tool that scans the current text for entries and uses an LLM to determine whether an F3 term has been used and then add automatic links/references within descriptions, leveraging AI for interlinking.
